# âœ¨ Portfolio

This is my new personal portfolio, developed using Astro, Svelte and TailwindCSS!

## TL;DR

After learning a couple of design basics (a long time ago) I began to see my old portfolio more and more as an endearing aberration. Don't get me wrong, I was very pleased with the result at the time and I put a lot into it, maybe _too much_.

I felt the need to give it a _little_ twist, simplify a couple of things, less quantity and more quality (mostly talking about text). In general, something slightly more "commercial" although maintaining the essence of the previous one with a new vision of how to do things.

That's how I ended up rewriting the entire project like any good programmer. Again, using a couple of technologies to learn along the way as usual and I'm pretty happy with the result!
